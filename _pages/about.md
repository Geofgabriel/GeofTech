My name is Gabriel and I work as a Data Scientist in a japanese tech company. I am based in
Buenos Aires, Argentina. Currently i am working in the area of generative ai, helping in the development of ai agents and building Avatars and voice chats (Azure Text-to-Speech services). Main of my experience is in the energy sector. This is due to my studies related to seismic data for geophysical exploration and the data science projects where i have been working on.  

From time to time, i add projects to my [github repository](https://github.com/Geofgabriel). Most of them are about geophysics or data science. I invite you to review it and leave any comment or improvement.
